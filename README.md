# Global state management with Remini

<!-- Perfect code splitting, pretty and minimalistic syntax, well structured and maintainable codebase. -->

Your coding time saver!

Minimal, well structured, and flexible codebase save a lot of developer time for maintain and grouth your React applications.

How it works

Usually when you just start React project or have a very small one, your codebase is short, undestable and simple, you can easily google examples of common issues.

But as you write the business logic of your application, the code gets larger and it becomes more and more difficult to understand the abundance of files, tricks and code pieces.

You should clear understand where is a place to your logic, how you can write as many code as you want without reduce your application maintance.

<!-- The key to this is modularity! -->

Enjoy and happy coding!
